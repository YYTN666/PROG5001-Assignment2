Algorithm 3:

Output a message: "Enter the threshold:"
Read the threshold value from user input and store it in the variable threshold
Close user input

Add the student names and total scores to the ArrayList and separate the names and scores with commas

Output a message: "Students with a total mark below the threshold " + threshold + ":"

For each string  in studentList:
    Split the student string using a comma and store the result in an array parts
    Get the student's name(studentName) from parts[0]
    Convert parts[1] to a double and store it in the variable totalMark

    If totalMark < threshold:
        Output  studentName
        Output a blank line
    End If
End For
