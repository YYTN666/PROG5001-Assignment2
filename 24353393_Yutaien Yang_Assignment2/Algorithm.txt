Algorithm 3:

Print "Enter the threshold:"
Read the threshold value from user input and store it in the variable threshold
Print "Students with a total mark below the threshold " + threshold + ":"
    For each student in studentList
        If student's totalMark < threshold
            Print student's name
        End If
    End For


Algorithm 4:

n = length of studentList
    
    for i from 0 to n - 1
        For j from 1 to n - i - 1
            if studentList[j - 1].getTotalMark() > studentList[j].getTotalMark()
                Swap studentList[j - 1] with studentList[j]
            End If
        End For

    Print "Top 5 Students:"
    For i from n - 1 down to max(n - 5, 0)
        student = studentList[i]
        Print student.getName() + " - " + student.getTotalMark()
    End For

    Print "Bottom 5 Students:"
    for i from 0 to min(5, n - 1)
        student = studentList[i]
        Print student.getName() + " - " + student.getTotalMark()
    End For
